<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This is my second project in my web development career.
It is a practice for ReactJS which I had some command over from the last project. 


### Built With
* [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)

### Explaination
- The project has a sign in functionality using Facebook Login

- Using Facebook Login the name as well as profile photo are taken

- The contacts as well as the stories are hard-coded but can be mapped to show all the information from the Firestore database

- The *Photo/Video* option can be used to upload pictures to the database

- The **Feed** is realtime updated to show your latest posts
